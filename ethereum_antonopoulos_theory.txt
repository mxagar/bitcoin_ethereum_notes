####################################

# Quick Glossary

	Several concepts are introduced briefly.
	This chapter/section should serve as a reference.

	Selected concepts

		Account
			object containing address, balance, optional storage, etc.
			an account can be
			- contract account: account that executes code whenever it receives a transaction
			- externally owned account (EOA): account created by/for a human
		Blockchain
			in contrast to the Bitcoin blockchain, there are no block size limits, instead gas limits are used
		Bycode
			like a compiled smart contract, executed on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)
		Constantinople fork
			fork that should switch Ethereum to a hybrid PoW/PoS
		DAO = Decentralized Autonomous Organization
			Orgs that function non-hierarchically and organically
			The DAO refers to a hack performed to a DAO, after which a hard fork was performed to revert to a previous state of the blockchain (and ETHs)
		DApp
			Decentrallized application = 
			smart contract + web interface
		Deed = NFT = Non-Fungible Token
		EIP
			Ethereum Improvement Proposal
		Ethash
			PoW algorithm on Ethereum 1.0
		Event
			DApps listen for events and run Javascript callbacks
		EVM = Ethereum Virtual Machine
			a stack-based virtual machine that executes bytecode
		Gas
			virtual fuel used to execute smart contracts
		Geth
			Go Ethereum: one of the most known implementations of the Ethereum protocol, written in Go
		HD = Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet
		ICAP = Inter-Exchange Client Address Protocol
			Ethereum Address enconding partly compatible with IBAN system!
			Pseudo-country code: XE
		Inmutable deployed code problem
			Once a conctract code is deployed, it cannot be changed - that is a problem if there is a bug/error in the deployed code.
		Keccak-256 = SHA3
			Hash function in Ethereum
		Keystore file
			JSON that contains an encrypted private key
		LevelDB
			key-value database from Google, used to store the Blockchain
		Mist
			The first Ethereum-enabled browser
		PoS = Proof-of-Stake
			Proof of ownership to add block to the blockchain and earn ETH
		Receipt
			result of a transaction with information of it: hash, block number, etc.
		Solidity
			most frequently used language for writing smart contracts
		Swarm
			decentralized P2P storage network
		Web3
			Concept proposed with Dr. Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum and co-author othe book
			web moves from centraly owned applications to decentralized ones
		Whisper
			decentralized P2P messaging service
