# Notes on Bitcoin and Ethereum

This repository contains my personal notes collected while studying the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.

The main source of information are the books by Andreas M. Antonopoulos:
- "Mastering Bitcoin", O'Reilly
- "Mastering Ethereum", O'Reilly
- "Mastering the Lightning Network", O'Reilly

Basically, I've done a summary of them.

Note that I don't use Markdown style, but my personal formatting in TXT: ideas are hierarchically indented -- I find this style to be very comfortable and fast for checking any information.
